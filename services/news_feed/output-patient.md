 Thought: I apologize for the confusion earlier, as it appears the search results provided were not relevant to the question about lifestyle changes to prevent dementia. Here are some simple examples of lifestyle changes that can help prevent dementia and improve cognitive health:

1. Regular physical activity: Engaging in regular exercise such as walking, swimming, or cycling can help boost brain functions like memory and thinking skills, and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.
2. Healthy diet: Consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats can support overall health and cognitive function. Some diets specifically designed to promote brain health include the Mediterranean diet and the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet.
3. Mental stimulation: Keeping the mind active through activities like reading, puzzles, or learning a new skill can help improve cognitive function and delay the onset of dementia.
4. Social engagement: Regular interaction with friends, family, and the community can provide mental stimulation and emotional support, which can contribute to maintaining cognitive health.
5. Adequate sleep: Getting enough restful sleep is essential for overall health and cognitive function, as it allows the brain to rest and consolidate memories.
6. Managing stress: Chronic stress can negatively impact cognitive function, so finding ways to manage stress through techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or exercise can help protect against dementia.
